# CPSC 321 Final Project

In this project, I emplemented a public bus's transportation interface using streamlit and a database server provided by the school. In the interface, you are able to see the buses traveling, their stops, open seating, and in separate tabs, you are able to see availible routes, as well as request new routes and stops. 

All of the access and database management is implemented using Python, and then the website hosting everything I made using streamlit.
